Welcome to my game of hangman.

# install

You will need to install the node modules. Open the terminal and make sure you are in the correct directory with cd (change directory)
to your folder.

in your terminal, enter:

npm i react

then enter:

npm start

The game will now run in your browser automatically.

# how to play

There is a hidden word. You need to guess which letters are in the word. For each guess you get wrong you will be one step closer to losing the game, demonstrated by the gradual death of a very well drawn stickman.

Guess letters by clicking on the keyboard. Good luck!

# help

# reset
